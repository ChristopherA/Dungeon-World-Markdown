# Dungeon World 

[Dungeon World](http://www.dungeon-world.com) is a fantasy tabletop roleplaying
game powered by the [Apocolypse World](http://apocalypse-world.com) engine and
written by [Sage LaTorra](http://www.latorra.org) and [Adam
Koebel](http://skinnyghost.tumblr.com). The full rules of the game are
avaliable on github here:

## Conversion

I have converted the XML text files to Markdown using [Aaron
Swartz's](http://www.aaronsw.com)
[aaronsw/html2text](https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text).

Markdown was selected as the target language for a few reasons:

    1. It is far more human readable than XML
    2. It is easy to convert to HTML (or any other markup language)
    3. It is very close to [vimiwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki)
       syntax (which I use extensively for my RPG needs)

## Issues

I'm sure there are issues where the automatic conversion failed. They will be
corrected as found.
